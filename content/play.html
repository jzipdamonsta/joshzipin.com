            My parents tell me that at 9 months I skipped crawling and went straight to running. My mom has been beating herself up about it for years but I think I turned out fine.

            I was friends with Stephen Curry in college. He once crushed me in golf and I've always regretted not keeping the scorecard.

            I like to run far. I once ran rim to rim in the Grand Canyon. Another time I was a part of a relay from San Francisco to LA. I also did the <a target="_blank" href='https://mtrp.org/5-peak-challenge/'>5 peaks challenge</a> with my friend, Gil.

            I have an amazing group of friends. In 2017 we rode our bikes from San Francisco to Anchorage, Alaska. Clif Bar made a <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_ZHhbH8WSs'>short film</a> about it.

            In 2018 we rode from Vancouver, BC to Halifax, Nova Scotia–clear across Canada. No one filmed it, but we raised $5k to clean up our oceans. Strava posted <a target="_blank" href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BkyihUoAs44/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link'>this photo</a> of me.

            I once organized an attempt to break the world record for <a target="_blank" href='https://handstandworldrecord.com'>most people doing a handstand</a>. We had enough people but Guinness rejected us on some technicality. Their loss, really.
