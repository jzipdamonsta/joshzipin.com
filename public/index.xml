      <description>JZ work play   Adventurer  My parents tell me that at 9 months I skipped crawling and went straight to running. My mom has been beating herself up about it for years but I think I turned out fine. I played Division I soccer at Davidson College and represented the United States in the Maccabiah Games in Israel. I was friends with Stephen Curry in college.</description>

      <description>JZ work play   Hustler  I made my first $100 in middle school selling baseball cards and mix CDs. In college I ran a $50k textbook business on campus. I sold sneakers. My first job was raising money for athletics at my alma mater, Davidson College. For fun I made a business plan for a Shark Tank entrepreneur making 100% recyclable sneakers. I moved to San Francisco.</description>
