            My parents tell me that at 9 months I skipped crawling and went straight to running. My mom has been beating herself up about it for years but I think I turned out fine.

            I played Division I soccer at Davidson College and represented the United States in the Maccabiah Games in Israel.

            I went to the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 and saw <a target="_blank" href='https://www.instagram.com/p/pVXNKBEfXR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link'>this</a> in person.

            I like to run far. I once ran rim to rim in the Grand Canyon. Another time I was a part of a relay from San Francisco to LA. I also did the <a target="_blank" href='https://mtrp.org/5-peak-challenge/'>5 peaks challenge</a> with my friend Gil.

            For three years I led the SF chapter of a free fitness movement called <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5tUQzIMs3c&feature=youtu.be'>November Project</a>. There’s probably <a target="_blank" href='https://november-project.com/locations/'>one near you.</a> #justshowup

            I have an amazing group of friends. In 2017 we rode our bikes from San Francisco to Anchorage, Alaska. Clif Bar made a <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_ZHhbH8WSs'>short film</a> about it.

            In 2018 we rode from Vancouver, BC to Halifax, Nova Scotia–clear across Canada. No one filmed it, but we raised $5k to clean up our oceans. Strava posted <a target="_blank" href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BkyihUoAs44/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link'>this photo</a> of me.

            I once organized an attempt to break the world record for <a target="_blank" href='https://handstandworldrecord.com'>most people doing a handstand</a>. We had enough people but Guinness rejected us on some technicality. Their loss, really.

            I’ve climbed Mount Shasta (14,180 feet) twice. The second time we cracked coconuts <a target="_blank" href='/images/top_of_shasta.jpeg'>at the top</a>.
